# FinalProject-VideoDownloader

This build a web crawler that download videos from a given keywords on video platform youtube by youtube-dl. Then, trim the video and keep the important content of the video and discard the rest of the video by scenedetect(detect-content)

I used the JavaFX as the GUI include botton, textfile, and listView to input the keywords, search the keywords, split the video about this keywords and remind user videos are downloaded. 

## Youtube

The java code are only focus on the youtube video by youtube-dl

## Instagram

This is not finished. I tried to use Instaloader which is to pictures or videos, but I can not find a way to limit the download file type and number, so I will only show this part by using shell script.
command line
instaloader “#hashtag” [keywords]  --no-pictures  --count=5

## Tiktok

I also tried to figure this platform out but the tool pytube and tiktok api both are not work for download by keywords.
